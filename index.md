## Introduction

The duck is lost and it your job to get it home (yes, YOU player, DON'T YOU ASK WHY, just DO IT!).   So you take on the task of doing so (DON'T IF ME).  

If you still dont know what to do look at the list bellow:

- the duck is able to go through portals to reach new areas
- the duck's home is a pond (it's okay if you don't see it, go through portals, eventually you would find it)
- the duck needs to navigate a maze
- take note that there are enemies that attack the duck (no worries, the duck can fight back)
- GOAL:get through the maze and get to the pond

### Player Movement

The player moves around with the w,a,s, and d keys (the duck moves though).
It shoots with mouse clicks and goes in the direction of the mouse cursor.

If the player touches the maze wall the duck goes back to the beginning.

The enemy shoot the player every 2 seconds and shoots towards the duck.

There is a label that shows the current health for the duck.

When you get to the pond, there is a winning message but if you lose
all of your health there is a lose message.

## Discussion

The hardest part was creating the maze.
The maze was all done with code and if I could go back,
I would use drawing tools to 

The most complex part was the score, and the win and lose message.

If I had more time, I would add more levels so the duck would have
to go through different mazes.
